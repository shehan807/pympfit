# Theory

**PyMPFIT** implements the MPFIT algorithm introduced by
[Ferenczy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.540120802) to
calculate partial atomic charges that reproduce the electrostatic potential of a
distributed multipole analysis. This is in contrast with traditional (e.g., RESP)
partial charge methods that reproduce the molecular electrostatic potential for a
given number of atomic sites. In these latter methods, site selection, molecular
orientation dependence, or charge assignment of symmetrically related centers
seemingly trouble such calculations.

Potential derived charges are, of course, methods in which the charges are not
obtained from the wave function, but rather, indirectly via electrostatic
potentials. In lieu of computing the entire wave function, constraining some lower
moments of the fitted charges to molecular multipole moments serves as a better
approach to utilizing information inherent to the wave function. In practice,
charges based on distributed multipole potentials and electrostatic potentials are
equivalent.

## Gaussian Distributed Multipole Analysis

The Gaussian Distributed Multipole Analysis (GDMA) introduced by
[Stone](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0009261481854528) provides
a rigorous framework for decomposing a molecular charge density into a series of
multipole moments localized on atomic centers. The electrostatic potential at a
given point in space, $\mathbf{r}$, can be expressed as a multipole expansion,

$$
V(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{r^{(n+1)}}\int (r')^n P_n(\cos{\alpha})\rho(\mathbf{r'})d\tau',
$$ (eq:esp_multipole)

where $P_n$ are Legendre polynomials and $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ is an arbitrary,
localized charge distribution. Molecular charge distributions are hence defined as

$$
\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{ij} D_{ij}\chi_i(\mathbf{r})\chi_j(\mathbf{r}),
$$ (eq:charge_density)

where $D_{ij}$ is an element of the density matrix, and $\chi(\mathbf{r})$ is a
normalized basis function, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian primitive
functions, i.e., local multipoles

$$
\chi_i(\mathbf{r}) = N_i x_i^{a_i} y_i^{b_i} z_i^{c_i} \exp{[-\zeta_i(\mathbf{r_i})^2]},
$$ (eq:basis_function)

where $a_i + b_i + c_i$ are equal to the angular momentum quantum number, $l$, and
$N_i$ is the basis function coefficient. Evaluating the higher moments of the
overlap density distribution (i.e., $\chi_i\chi_j$) yields the multipole moment of
order $lm$,

$$
Q_{lm} = \int R_{lm}(\mathbf{r})\rho(\mathbf{r})d^3\mathbf{r},
$$ (eq:one_center_moment)

where $R_{lm}$ is a regular solid harmonic. GDMA expands Equation
{eq}`eq:one_center_moment` by *distributing* such moments across atoms and bonds
(or even arbitrary virtual sites), serving as a physically interpretable bridge
between QM charge density and classical force field electrostatics.

## MPFIT

The MPFIT (multipole fitting) procedure originally outlined by
[Ferenczy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.540120802) represents
the traditional approach to deriving atom-centered partial charges from GDMA output.
Formally, this is achieved by minimizing the difference between the potential
created by the distributed multipole moments, $V^{\text{GDMA}}(\mathbf{r})$, and
that generated by the fitted charges, $V^{Q}(\mathbf{r})$,

$$
f(\mathbf{r}) = V^{\text{GDMA}}(\mathbf{r}) - V^{Q}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{a}\sum_{l,m} Q_{lm}^{a}I_{lm}^{a}(\mathbf{r}) - \sum_{i} q_i I_{00}^{i}(\mathbf{r}),
$$ (eq:mpfit_potential_diff)

where $Q_{lm}^{a}$ denotes the $m$th component of the rank-$l$ multipole moment
centered at site $a$, $q_i$ are the point charges, and
$I_{lm}^{a}(\mathbf{r}) = r_a^{-(l+1)}C_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$ are irregular solid
harmonics. The optimal charges are obtained by minimizing the integrated squared
error,

$$
\frac{\delta}{\delta q_j^a} \int [f(\mathbf{r})]^2 r^2 \sin\theta \, dr \, d\theta \, d\phi = 0,
$$ (eq:mpfit_minimize)

which yields a linear system of the form $Aq^a = b$, where the elements of $A$ and
$b$ depend on regular and irregular solid harmonics across atomic centers and
multipole ranks. Solving for $q^a = A^{-1}b$ yields the set of least-squares charges
that best reproduce the distributed multipole potential.

The explicit form of the design matrix problem requires additional mathematics.
Suppose the distance between the multipole center and the point where the potential
is to be calculated ($r-r_a$) is greater than the distance between multipoles and
the charge site ($r_{ia}$), then

$$
I_{00}^{i}(r) = \sum_{lm} R_{lm}(r_{ia}) I_{lm}^a(r) = \sum_{lm} R_{lm}^a(r_i) I^{a}_{lm}(r)
$$ (eq:irregular_expansion)

where $R_{lm}(r)$ is a regular spherical harmonic defined as

$$
R_{lm}(r) = r^{2l+1}I_{lm}(r)
$$ (eq:regular_harmonic)

This allows for simplification of the original equation to,

$$
f(r) = \sum_a\sum_{l,m}I_{lm}^a(r)[Q_{lm}^a - \sum_{i}q_{i}^{a}R_{lm}^{a}(r_i)] = \sum_{a}f^{a}(r)
$$ (eq:simplified_potential)

We can eliminate $I_{lm}^{a}(r)$ by integration. Namely, the integration of
$[f(r)]^2$ yields the optimum set of net charges based on an appropriate integral
bound in polar coordinates. Via chain rule, it can be shown that the integrand
becomes:

$$
\frac{\delta [f(r)]^2}{\delta q_{j}^b} = 2 \sum_a\sum_{l,m}\sum_{l',m'} I_{lm}^{a}(r) I_{l'm'}^{b}(r) R_{l'm'}(r_j) \times \left[\sum_i q_i^a R_{lm}^a(r_i) - Q_{lm}^a\right]
$$ (eq:chain_rule)

which, after plugging back into the integral, can be formulated as $Aq = b$ where

$$
A_{ij}^{ab} = \sum_{l,m}\sum_{l',m'} K_{lm,l'm'}^{ab} R_{lm}^a (r_i) R_{l'm'}^b (r_j)
$$ (eq:A_matrix_full)

and

$$
b_j^b = \sum_a\sum_{l,m}\sum_{l',m'} K_{lm,l'm'}^{ab} R_{l'm'}^b(r_j) Q_{lm}^a
$$ (eq:b_vector_full)

where

$$
K_{lm,l'm'}^{ab} (\rho_1,\rho_2) = \int_{\rho_1}^{\rho_2}\int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2}\int_{\phi_1}^{\phi_2} I_{lm}^a(r) I_{l'm'}^b(r) r^2 \sin\theta \, dr \, d\theta \, d\phi
$$ (eq:K_integral)

Computing the off-diagonal components of this approach would be cumbersome
($a\neq b$), especially in the case of having some grid construction involved in
molecular electrostatic potential- or field-derived methods. To this end, recall
that the optimization can be broken up into the sum of $f(r)$ at each spherical
layer around point $a$:

$$
F^a(\rho_1,\rho_2) = \sum_{l,m} \frac{4\pi}{2l + 1} W_{\rho_1,\rho_2,l} \left[Q_{lm}^a - \sum_iq_i^aR_{lm}^a(r_i)\right]^2
$$ (eq:F_optimization)

where the $W_{\rho_1,\rho_2,l}$ factors

$$
W_{\rho_1,\rho_2,l} = \int_{\rho_1}^{\rho_2} r^2r^{-2(l+1)} dr = \frac{1}{1-2l}\left(\rho_2^{1-2l} - \rho_1^{1-2l}\right)
$$ (eq:W_weights)

weight the importance of the multipoles of rank $l$. Now, we just need to solve for

$$
\frac{\delta F^a}{\delta q_j^a} = 2 \sum_{l,m} \frac{4\pi}{2l+1} W_{\rho_1,\rho_2,l} \left[ Q_{lm}^a - \sum_i q_iR_{lm}^a(r_i)\right]R_{lm}^a(r_j) = 0
$$ (eq:F_derivative)

where the new $Aq^a = b$ matrix equation is solved by creating the following $A$
and $b$ matrices:

$$
A_{ij}^a = \sum_{lm}\frac{1}{2l+1}R_{lm}^a(r_i) R_{l'm'}^b(r_j) W_{\rho_1,\rho_2,l}
$$ (eq:A_matrix_final)

$$
b_j^a = \sum_{lm}\frac{1}{2l+1}R_{lm}^a(r_i) Q_{lm}^a W_{\rho_1,\rho_2,l}
$$ (eq:b_vector_final)

where the partial charges are determined via

$$
q^a = A^{-1}b
$$ (eq:charge_solution)

where

$$
q_i = \sum_a q_i^a = \sum_a A_a^{-1}b^a
$$ (eq:total_charge)
